CrystalStars
============

CrystalStars:

The crystalStars module defines the classes corresponding to stars (in this case, for solute-vacancy complexes that are equivalent by space group symmetry), and vector stars (the inclusion of a vector basis on the stars). These modules are primarily responsible for all the symmetry analysis, and converting that into matrix forms for rapid numerical evaluation as needed.
