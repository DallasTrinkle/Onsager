# Five frequency inputs to fivefreq.py
# Each line has w0 w1 w2 w3 w4
# w0 = rate of vacancy jump without solute
# w1 = rate of vacancy jump between 1st nn of solute
# w2 = rate of vacancy/solute exchange
# w3 = rate of vacancy escape from solute 1st nn
# w4 = return rate for w3; rate of formation of complex
