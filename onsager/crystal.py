Crystal class

Class to store definition of a crystal, along with some analysis
1. geometric analysis (nearest neighbor displacements)
2. space group operations
3. point group operations for each basis position
4. Wyckoff position generation (for interstitials)

        Initialization; starts off with the lattice vector definition and the
        basis vectors. While it does not explicitly store the specific chemical
        elements involved, it does store that there are different elements.

        Parameters
        ----------
        lattice : array[3,3] or list of array[3]
            lattice vectors; if [3,3] array, then the vectors need to be in *column* format
            so that the first lattice vector is lattice[:,0]

        basis : list of array[3] or list of list of array[3]
            crystalline basis vectors, in unit cell coordinates. If a list of lists, then
            there are multiple chemical elements, with each list corresponding to a unique
            element
