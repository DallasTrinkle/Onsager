[![PyPI version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/onsager.svg)](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/onsager)

Documentation now available at the [Onsager github page](http://dallastrinkle.github.io/Onsager/). Please cite as [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/14172/DallasTrinkle/Onsager.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/14172/DallasTrinkle/Onsager) or see `Onsager github <https://github.com/DallasTrinkle/Onsager>`_ for current version doi information.

The Onsager package provides routines for the general calculation of transport coefficients in vacancy-mediated diffusion and interstitial diffusion. It does this using a Green function approach, combined with point group symmetry reduction for maximum efficiency.

Typical usage can be seen in the ipython notebooks in `examples`; the usual import will be::

    #!/usr/bin/env python

	from onsager import crystal
	from onsager import OnsagerCalc

    ...

Many of the subpackages within Onsager are support for the main attraction, which is in OnsagerCalc. Interstitial calculation examples are available in `bin`, including three YAML input files, as well as a interstitial diffuser. An example of vacancy-mediated diffusion is shown in `bin/fivefreq.py`, which computes the well-known five-frequency model for substitutional solute transport in an FCC lattice. The script `CLdiffuser` is a command-line diffuser calculator that is designed to read in an HDF5 file of a diffuser, along with a JSON file that includes the thermal/kinetic data, and computes diffusivity components for different temperatures.

The tests for the package are include in `test`; `tests.py` will run all of the tests in the directory with verbosity level 2. This can be time-consuming (on the order of several of minutes) to run all tests; coverage is currently >90%.

The code uses YAML format for input/output of crystal structures, and diffusion data for the interstitial calculator. The vacancy-mediated calculator requires much more data, and uses HDF5 format to save/reload as needed. The vacancy-mediated calculator uses tags (unique human-readable-ish strings) to identify all (symmetry-unique) vacancy, solute, and complex states, and transitions between them.
The vacancy-mediated diffuser can be stored as an HDF5 file (which internally stores the crystal structure in YAML format). The thermal/kinetic data is most easily serialized as JSON, but any dictionary-compatible format will do, by making use of tags.
