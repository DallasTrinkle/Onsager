    "## Assumptions used in Onsager\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Onsager` code computes transport of defects on an infinite crystalline lattice. Currently, the code requires that the particular defects can be mapped onto Wyckoff positions in a crystal. This does not *require* that the defect be an atom occupying various Wyckoff positions (though that obviously is captured), but merely that the defect have the symmetry and transitions that can be equivalently described by an \"object\" that occupies Wyckoff positions. Simple examples include vacancies, substitutional solutes, simple interstitial atoms, as well as more complex cases such as split vacancy defects (e.g.: a V-O$_\\text{i}$-V split double vacancy with oxygen interstitial in a closed-packed crystal; the entire defect complex can be mapped on to the Wyckoff position of the oxygen interstitial). In order to calculate diffusion, a few assumptions are made:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **defects are dilute:** we never consider more than one defect at a time in an \"infinite\" periodic crystal; the vacancy-mediated diffuser uses one vacancy and one solute.\n",
    "* **defects diffuse via a Markovian process**: defect states are well-defined, and the transition time from state-to-state is much longer than the equilibration time in a state, so that the evolution of the system is described by the Master equation with time-independent rates.\n",
    "* **defects do not alter the underlying symmetry of the crystal**: while the defect itself can have a lower symmetry (according to its Wyckoff position), the presence of a defect does not lead to a global phase transformation to a different crystal; moreover, the crystal maintains translational invariance so that the energy of the system with defect(s) is unchanged under translations.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of these assumptions are usually good: the dilute limit is valid without strong interactions (such as site blocking), Markovian processes are valid as long as barriers are a few times $k_\\text{B}T$, and we are not currently aware of any (simple) defects that induce phase transformations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, relaxation around a defect (or defect cluster) is allowed, but the assumption is that all of the atomic positions can be easily mapped back to \"perfect\" crystal lattice sites. This is an \"off-lattice\" model. In some cases, it can be possible to incorporate \"new\" states, especially metastable states, that are only accessible by a defect.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the code requires that all diffusion happens on a single sublattice. This sublattice is defined by a single chemical species; it can include multiple Wyckoff positions. But the current algorithms assume that transitions do not result in the creation of *antisite defects* (where a chemical species is on an \"incorrect\" sublattice).\n"

    "## Crystal class setup\n",
    "\n",
    "The assumption of translational invariance of our defects is captured by the use of a `Crystal` object. Following the standard definition of a crystal, we need to specify (a) three lattice vectors, and (b) at least one basis position, corresponding to at least one site. The crystal needs to contain *at least* the Wyckoff positions on a single sublattice corresponding to the diffusing defects. It can be useful for it to contain *more* atoms that act as \"spectator\" atoms: they do not participate in diffusion, but define both the underlying symmetry of the crystal, and if atomic-scale calculations will be used to compute configuration and transition-state energies, are necessary to define the energy landscape of diffusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "The lattice vectors of the underlying crystal set the units of *length* in the transport coefficients. Hence, if the vectors are entered in units of nm, this corresponds to a factor of $10^{-18}\\text{ m}^2$ in the transport coefficients. This should also be considered when including factors of volume per atom as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The *lattice vectors* are given by three vectors, $\\mathbf{a}_1$, $\\mathbf{a}_2$, $\\mathbf{a}_3$ in Cartesian coordinates. In python, these are input when creating a Crystal either as a list of three `numpy` vectors, *or* as a square `numpy` matrix. **Note:** if you enter the three vectors as a matrix, remember that **it assumes the vectors are column vectors**. That is, if `amat` is the matrix, then `amat[:,0]` is $\\mathbf{a}_1$, `amat[:,1]` is $\\mathbf{a}_2$, and `amat[:,2]` is $\\mathbf{a}_3$. **This may not be what you're expecting.** The main recommendation is to enter the lattice vectors as a list (or tuple) of three `numpy` vectors.\n",
    "* The *atomic basis* is given by a *list* of *lists* of `numpy` vectors of positions in *unit cell coordinates*. For a given `basis`, then `basis[0]` is a list of all positions for the first chemical element in the crystal, `basis[1]` is the second chemical element, and so on. **If you only have a single chemical element, you may enter a list of `numpy` vectors.**\n",
    "* An optional *spin* degree of freedom can be included. This is a list of objects, with one for each chemical element. These can be either scalar or vectors, with the assumption that they transform as those objects under group operations. If not included, the spins are all assumed to be equal to 0. Inclusion of these additional degrees of freedom (currently) only impacts the reduction of the unit cell, and the construction of the space group operations.\n",
    "* We also take in, strictly for bookkeeping purposes, a list of names for the chemical elements. *This is an optional input*, but recommended for readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once initialized, two main internal operations take place:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The unit cell is *reduced* and *optimized*. Reduction is a process where we try to find the smallest unit cell representation for the `Crystal`. This means that the four-atom \"simple cubic\" unit cell of face-centered cubic can be input, and the code will reduce it to the standard single-atom primitive cell. The reduction algorithm can end up with \"unusual\" choices of lattice vectors, so we also optimize the lattice vectors so that they are as close to orthogonal as possible, and ordered from smallest to largest. The atomic basis may be shifted uniformly so that *if* an inversion operation is present, then the inversion center is the origin. Neither choice changes the representation of the crystal; however, the *reduction* operation can be skipped by including the option `noreduce=True`.\n",
    "2. Full symmetry analysis is performed, including: automated construction of space group generator operators, partitioning of basis sites into symmetry related Wyckoff positions, and determination of point group operations for every basis site. All of these operations are automated, and make no reference to crystallographic tables. The algorithm cannot identify which space group it has generated, nor which Wyckoff positions are present. The algorithm respects both *chemistry* and *spin*; this also makes spin a useful manipulation tool to artificially lower symmetry for testing purposes as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: `Crystal`s can also be constructed by manipulating existing `Crystal` objects. A useful case is for the interstitial diffuser: when working \"interactively,\" it is often easier to first make the underlying \"spectator\" crystal, and then have that `Crystal` construct the set of Wyckoff positions for a single site in the crystal, and then add that to the basis. `Crystal` objects are intended to be read-only, so these manipulations result in the creation of a new `Crystal` object.\n",

As for any diffusion calculator, we need to define the configurations that the defect will sample, and the transition states of the defect. In the case of a single defect species,\n",

    "We use the `sitelist(chemistry)` function to construct a *list* of *lists* of indices for a given `chemistry`; the lists of indices are all symmetrically equivalent crystal basis indices, and each list is symmetrically inequivalent: this is a space group partitioning into equivalent Wyckoff positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The transition states are stored as a `jumpnetwork`, which is a *list* of *lists* of *tuples* of transitions: `(initial index, final index, deltax)` where the indices are self-explanatory, and `deltax` is a Cartesian vector corresponding to the translation from the initial state to the final state. The transitions in each list is equivalent by symmetry, and the separate lists are symmetrically inequivalent. Note also that *reverse* transitions are included: `(final index, initial index, -deltax)`. While the jumpnetwork can be constructed \"by hand,\" it is recommended to use the `jumpnetwork()` function inside of a crystal to automate the generation, and then remove \"spurious\" transitions that are identified.\n",

    "\n",
    "The interstitial diffuser also identifies unique **tags** for all configurations and transition states. The interstitial tags for *configurations* are strings with `i:` followed by unit cell coordinates of site to three decimal digits. The interstitial tags for *transition states* are strings with `i:` followed by the unit cell coordinates of the initial state, a `^`, and the unit cell coordinates of the final state. When one pretty-prints the interstitial diffuser object, the symmetry unique tags are printed. Note that all of the symmetry equivalent tags are stored in the object, and can be used to identify configurations and transition states, and this is the preferred method for indexing, rather than relying on the particular index into the corresponding lists. The interstitial diffuser calculator contains dictionaries that can be used to convert from tags to indices and vice versa.\n",
    "\n",

    "For the vacancy mediated diffuser, the configurations and transition states are more complicated. First, we have three types of configurations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Vacancy, sufficiently far away from the solute to have zero interaction energy.\n",
    "2. Solute, sufficiently far away from the vacancy to have zero interaction energy.\n",
    "3. Vacancy-solute complexes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The vacancies and solutes are assumed to be able to occupy the *same* sites in the crystal, and that neither the vacancy or solute lowers the underlying symmetry of the site. This is a rephrasing of our previous assumption that the symmetry of the defect can be mapped onto the symmetry of the crystal Wyckoff position. There are cases where *this is not true*: that is, some solutes, when substituted into a crystal, will relax in a way that *breaks symmetry*. While mathematically this can be treated, we do not currently have an implementation that supports this.\n",
    "\n",
    "The complexes are only considered out to a finite distance; this is called the \"thermodynamic range.\" It is defined in terms of \"shells,\" which is the number of \"jumps\" from the solute in order to reach the vacancy. We include one more shell out, called the \"kinetic range,\" which are complexes that include transitions to complexes in the thermodynamic range.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we consider transition states, we have three types of transition states:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Vacancy transitions, sufficiently far away from the solute to have zero interaction energy.\n",
    "2. Vacancy-solute complex transitions, where only the vacancy changes position (both between complexes in the thermodynamic range, and between the kinetic and thermodynamic range).\n",
    "3. Vacancy-solute complex transitions, where the vacancy and solute exchange place.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are called, in the \"five-frequency framework\", omega-0, omega-1, and omega-2 jumps, respectively. The five-frequency model technically identifies omega-1 jumps as *only* between complexes in the thermodynamic range, while the two \"additional\" jump types, omega-3 and omega-4, connect complexes in the kinetic range to the thermodynamic range. Operationally, we combine omega-1, -3, and -4 into a single set.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make a diffuser, we need to\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Identify the `sitelist` of the vacancies (and hence, solutes),\n",
    "2. Identify the `jumpnetwork` of the vacancies\n",
    "3. Determine the thermodynamic range\n",
    "\n",
    "then, the diffuser automatically constructs the complexes out to the thermodynamic range, and the full jumpnetworks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The vacancy-mediated diffuser also identifies unique **tags** for all configurations and transition states. The tags for *configurations* are strings with \n",

There are two primary steps: (1) constructing appropriate \"supercells\" containing defect configurations and transition states to be computed, and (2) extracting the appropriate information from those calculations to use in the diffuser. This section deals with the former; the next section will deal with the latter.\n",

To make supercells with defects, we take advantage of the `supercell` module in `Onsager`; both calculators contain a `makesupercell()` function that returns dictionaries of supercells, tags, and appropriate information. Currently, to transform these into usable input files, the `automator` module can convert such dictionaries into tarballs with an appropriate directory structure, files containing information about appropriate tags for the different configurations, a `Makefile` that converts `CONTCAR` output into appropriate `POS` input for the nudged-elastic band calculation.\n",

    "## Formatting of input data\n",
    "Once the atomic-scale data from an appropriate total energy calculation is finished, the data needs to be input into formats that the appropriate diffusion calculator can understand. There are some common definitions between the two, but some differences as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "In all cases, we work with the assumption that our states are thermally occupied, and our rates are Arrhenius. That means that the (relative) probability of any state can be written as\n",
    "$$\\rho = Z^{-1}\\rho^0 \\exp(-E/k_\\text{B}T)$$\n\n",
    "for the partition function $Z$, a site entropic term $\\rho^0 = \\exp(S/k_\\text{B})$, and energy $E$. The transition rate from state A to state B is given by\n",
    "$$\\lambda(\\text{A}\\to\\text{B}) = \\frac{\\nu^\\text{T}_{\\text{A}-\\text{B}}}{\\rho^0_A} \\exp(-(E^\\text{T}_{\\text{A}-\\text{B}} - E_\\text{A})/k_\\text{B}T)$$\n\n",
    "where $E^\\text{T}_{\\text{A}-\\text{B}}$ is the energy of the transition state between A and B, and $\\nu^\\text{T}_{\\text{A}-\\text{B}}$ is the prefactor for the transition state.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we assume harmonic transition state theory, then we can write the site entropic term $\\rho^0$ as\n",
    "$$\\rho^0 = \\frac{\\prod \\nu^{\\text{defect-supercell}}}{\\prod \\nu^{\\text{perfect-supercell}}}$$\n\n",
    "where $\\nu$ are the vibrational eigenvalues of the corresponding supercells, and the prefactor for the transition state is\n",
    "$$\\nu^\\text{T} = \\frac{\\prod \\nu^{\\text{perfect-supercell}}}{\\prod_{\\nu^2>0} \\nu^{\\text{transition state}}}$$\n\n",
    "where we take the product over the real vibrational frequencies in the transition state (there should be one imaginary mode). From a practical point of view, the perfect-supercell cancels out; we will often set $\\rho^0$ to 1 for a single state (so that the other $\\rho^0$ are relative probabilities), and then $\\nu^\\text{T}$ becomes more similar to the attempt frequency for the particular jumps. The definitions above map most simply onto a \"hopping atom\" approximation for the jump rates: the $3\\times3$ force-constant matrix is computed for the atom that is moving in the transition, and its eigenvalues are used to determine the modes $\\nu$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note the units: $\\rho^0$ is unitless, while $\\nu^\\text{T}$ has units of inverse time; this means that the inverse time unit in the computed transport coefficients will come from $\\nu^\\text{T}$ values. If they are entered in THz, that contributes $10^{12}\\text{ s}^{-1}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we normalize our probabilities, our energies and transition state energies are relative to each other. In all of our calculations, we will multiply energies by $\\beta=(k_\\text{B}T)^{-1}$ to get a unitless values as inputs for our diffusion calculators. This means that the diffusers *do not have direct information about temperature*; explicit temperature factors that appear in the Onsager coefficients must be included by hand from the output transport coefficients. It also means that the calculators do not have a \"unit\" of energy; rather, $k_\\text{B}T$ and the energies must be in the same units.\n"
