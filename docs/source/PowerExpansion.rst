PowerExpansion
==============

PowerExpansion:

The PowerExpansion module defines the ``Taylor3D`` class, which is for 3-dimensional (xyz) Taylor expansions of functions. It's primary purpose is to be used in the calculation of the vacancy Green function, as it allows fairly straightforward block evaluation of the small *k* (large distance) transition matrix, and its inverse. This is key to removing the pole in the Green function evaluation.
