    "## <110>-oriented dumbbell diffusion in Fe-dilute X (X=Cu, Ni, Si) alloy.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll create and save a onsager transport coefficient calculator for dumbbell diffusion in Fe-dilute Cu, Ni and Si alloys using all dumbbell diffusion mechanisms in the paper by Messina et. al. at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.actamat.2020.03.038, with the migration barrier data provided in the corresponding database. These mechanism include the 60-degree roto-translation mechanism of <110> dumbbells, as well as rigid translations and on-site rotations, but for the mixed dumbbells, on-site rotations are not considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, we need to create a 1nn3 thermodynamic shell (all sites up to the first of first of first nearest neighbors of the solute), large enough to encompass all the solute-dumbbell configurations mentioned in this paper, and also extract out the necessary dumbbell jumps from those created created by our code."
